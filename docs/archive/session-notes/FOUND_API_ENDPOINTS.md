# Found API Endpoints! 🎉

## ✅ What We Discovered

From your console errors, I can see these API endpoints exist:

1. **`/me`** - User/authentication endpoint (401 error)
2. **`/products`** - Products endpoint (401 error)  
3. **`/analytics`** - Analytics endpoint (401 error)

The **401 errors** mean:
- ✅ The endpoints **EXIST** (not 404!)
- ⚠️ They require **authentication** (you're not logged in or session expired)

## 🔍 Next Step: Find the Full API URLs

We need to see the **complete URLs** of these endpoints. Here's how:

### Method 1: Check Network Tab

1. In the **Network tab**, look for requests named:
   - `me`
   - `products`
   - `analytics`

2. **Click on one** (like `me` or `products`)

3. Check the **Headers tab**:
   - Look for **"Request URL"** - this is the full API endpoint!
   - It might be: `https://extremedeptkidz.com/api/me` or similar

### Method 2: Check Console Errors

1. In the **Console tab**, click on one of the error messages
2. It might show the full URL in the error details

### Method 3: Filter Network Tab

1. In **Network tab**, use the **filter/search box**
2. Type: `me` or `products` or `api`
3. This will show only those requests
4. Click on them to see the full URL

## 📋 What We Need

Please share:

1. **Full API Base URL** - What's the common prefix?
   - Example: `https://extremedeptkidz.com/api`
   - Or: `https://extremedeptkidz.com/admin/api`

2. **Complete Endpoint URLs:**
   - `/me` → Full URL: `_________________`
   - `/products` → Full URL: `_________________`
   - `/analytics` → Full URL: `_________________`

3. **Authentication Method:**
   - When you click on the `me` request in Network tab, check:
     - **Headers** → Is there an `Authorization` header?
     - **Headers** → Is there a `Cookie` header?
     - What does it say?

---

## 🚀 Quick Check

In the **Network tab**:

1. **Filter** by typing `me` or `products` in the search box
2. **Click on the request** (it will be highlighted)
3. **Check Headers tab** → **Request URL**
4. **Share that URL** with me!

## 💡 What This Means

Since we found these endpoints, I can now:

1. ✅ Update the warehouse POS to use these endpoints
2. ✅ Configure authentication to match your admin panel
3. ✅ Map the endpoints correctly:
   - `/me` → Get current user
   - `/products` → Get products list
   - `/analytics` → Get analytics data

**Can you check the Network tab and share the full Request URL for the `me` or `products` endpoint?** That's all I need! 🎯
