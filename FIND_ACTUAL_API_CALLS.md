# Finding the Actual API Calls

## ⚠️ What You Just Showed Me

`https://extremedeptkidz.com/admin/products` is the **page URL** (where you navigate), not the API endpoint.

We need to find the **API calls** that fetch data (JSON), not page navigations.

---

## 🎯 How to Find API Calls

### Step 1: Filter Network Tab for API Calls Only

1. In the **Network tab**, look for a **filter/search box** at the top
2. Type: `fetch` or `xhr` or `api`
3. This will show only API requests (not page loads, images, etc.)

### Step 2: Look for JSON Responses

API calls will:
- Have a **Type** of `fetch` or `xhr` (not `document`)
- Return **JSON data** (not HTML)
- Have a **Status** like `200`, `401`, `404`, etc.

### Step 3: Check When Page Loads

1. **Clear** the Network tab (click Clear button 🚫)
2. **Refresh** the `/admin/products` page (Cmd+R)
3. **Watch** for API calls as the page loads
4. Look for requests that:
   - Are NOT `document` type
   - Have names like `products`, `me`, `analytics`
   - Return JSON (check Response tab)

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

Based on your console errors, the API endpoints are likely:

- `/api/products` or `/admin/api/products`
- `/api/me` or `/admin/api/me`
- `/api/analytics` or `/admin/api/analytics`

When you see these in the Network tab:

1. **Click on the request** (like `products` or `me`)
2. Check **Headers tab** → **Request URL** (this is the full API endpoint!)
3. Check **Response tab** → Should show JSON data (even if it's an error)

---

## 💡 Quick Method

Try this:

1. **Clear** Network tab
2. **Refresh** the page (Cmd+R)
3. In Network tab, **look for requests** that:
   - Have a **red status** (401 error) - these are the API calls!
   - Are **Type: fetch** or **Type: xhr**
   - Have names like `me`, `products`, `analytics`

4. **Click on the red/failed request** (like `me` or `products`)
5. Check **Headers tab** → **Request URL** - this is what we need!

---

## 📋 What We Need

When you find the API call, share:

1. **Request URL** - Full URL like:
   - `https://extremedeptkidz.com/api/products`
   - `https://extremedeptkidz.com/admin/api/products`
   - Or similar

2. **Request Method** - GET, POST, etc.

3. **Headers** - Especially:
   - `Authorization: Bearer ...` or
   - `Cookie: ...` or
   - Other auth headers

---

## 🚀 Alternative: Check Console Errors

The console errors showed `/me` and `/products` endpoints. These are likely:

- `https://extremedeptkidz.com/api/me`
- `https://extremedeptkidz.com/api/products`

But we need to confirm the full URL. Can you:

1. **Right-click** on one of the console errors (like the `me` error)
2. See if it shows the full URL
3. Or check if there's a "Source" link that shows the URL

**Try filtering the Network tab for `fetch` or `api` and look for the failed requests (401 errors) - those are the API calls!** 🎯
