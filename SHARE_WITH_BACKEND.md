# 📤 Files to Share with Backend Developer

## Quick Start

Share these **3 files** with your backend developer:

1. ✅ **`BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md`** - Complete API specification (MOST IMPORTANT)
2. ✅ **`BACKEND_API_SETUP.md`** - Implementation examples
3. ✅ **`EMAIL_TO_BACKEND_DEV.md`** - Ready-to-send email template

---

## 📋 What Each File Contains

### 1. BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md
**Purpose:** Complete API specification document

**Contains:**
- All required endpoints with request/response formats
- CORS configuration requirements
- Authentication methods
- Error response formats
- Testing checklist

**Share this first** - it's the main requirements document.

---

### 2. BACKEND_API_SETUP.md
**Purpose:** Implementation examples and guidance

**Contains:**
- Laravel/PHP code examples
- Node.js/Express code examples
- Framework-specific implementation guides
- CORS configuration examples

**Share this** if your backend developer needs code examples.

---

### 3. EMAIL_TO_BACKEND_DEV.md
**Purpose:** Ready-to-send email template

**Contains:**
- Professional email template
- Key information summary
- Priority endpoints list
- Testing instructions

**Use this** to send a professional email with the requirements.

## 🎯 Key Points to Emphasize

When sharing with your backend developer, make sure to highlight:

1. **CORS is CRITICAL** - Without proper CORS, the frontend won't work
2. **Frontend Domain:** `https://warehouse.extremedeptkidz.com`
3. **API Base URL:** `https://extremedeptkidz.com/api`
4. **Test Credentials:** `info@extremedeptkidz.com` / `Admin123!@#`

## 📧 How to Share

### Option 1: Email
1. Open `EMAIL_TO_BACKEND_DEV.md`
2. Copy the email content

### Option 3: Repository/Shared Folder
1. Upload all 3 files to a shared location
2. Share the link with your backend developer

## ✅ After Sharing

Once you've shared the documents:

1. **Wait for confirmation** - Backend developer acknowledges receipt
2. **Set timeline** - Agree on implementation timeline
3. **Priority endpoints** - Confirm which endpoints will be implemented first
4. **Testing plan** - Agree on how to test the integration

---

## 🔄 Follow-up Checklist

After backend implementation:

- [ ] Backend developer confirms endpoints are ready
- [ ] Test login endpoint: `POST /api/auth/login`
- [ ] Test user endpoint: `GET /api/auth/user`
- [ ] Verify CORS is configured correctly
- [ ] Test in browser (check Network tab)
- [ ] Run `./test-api.sh` script
- [ ] Verify no CORS errors in browser console
